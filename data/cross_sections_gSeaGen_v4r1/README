These root files contain TGraphs representing the cross-sections used in gSeaGen v4r1.

gSeaGen v4r1 is used for the 2016 9m ORCA production (see http://wiki.km3net.de/index.php/Simulations/ORCA_productions#ORCA115_9m_Layout_2016).

These files were obtained by Martijn Jongen on 12 October 2017 in the following way.

The gSeaGen installation used for the MC production can be found in Lyon:

/afs/in2p3.fr/home/throng/km3net/src/gSeaGen/v4r1

This installation comes with the following cross-section files (found in the 'dat' directory):

These files are Genie cross-section splines in xml format. For more info on these, see chapter 5 of

"The GENIE Neutrino Monte Carlo Generator: Physics and User Manual"
(arXiv:1510.05494v1 [hep-ph]).

For the extraction, the xml files are converted to root format using the GENIE utility program gspl2root (see chapter 5.2.5). The spline data written-out have the energies given in GeV and the cross sections given in 10eâˆ’38 cm^2.

The scripts with which this was done are included in this folder. They can be run in Lyon:
- first do 'source setenv_gSeaGen.sh' to set up the environment for this gSeaGen version
- then do './make_cs.sh' to make a root file called 'xsec_full.root' containing the information from the gSeaGen xml files. It contains TGraphs of the cross-section for all individual subprocesses.
- then do 'root -b -q -l extract_total_cs.C' to extract only the total CC and NC cross-section TGraphs from 'xsec_full.root'. These are saved to the final output file called 'xsec.root' (this last step is just to save disk space)
