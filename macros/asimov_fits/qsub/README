This folder contains the scripts used to run the percentage plot on the grid engine qsub.
These scripts will attempt to run the percentage MC calculation script found in 
`$MONADIR/macros/asimov_fits/cross_check_macros/`. 

To run scripts on qsub the following standard steps have to be taken:
 - Define a script to run with some (or no) input parameters.
 - Generate a number of scripts that take this base script with input, this is typically done 
   with python.
 - Submit these generated scripts to the grid with qsub.
