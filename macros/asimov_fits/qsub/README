===== README =====

This folder contains the scripts used to run the percentage plot on the grid engine qsub.
These scripts will attempt to run the percentage MC calculation script found in 
`$MONADIR/macros/asimov_fits/cross_check_macros/`. 

To run scripts on qsub the following standard steps have to be taken:
 - Define a script to run with some (or no) input parameters.
 - Generate a number of scripts that take this base script with input, this is typically done 
   with python.
 - Submit these generated scripts to the grid with qsub.


====== Changing run parameters =====

To change a run of jobs to use a different MC input file do the following steps:
 - Change the output name of the text file that is written in `AsimovFitNBinsXOTh23Range_PercentageOfMC.C`
   to contain "_20m" (or whatever appendage you need)
 - Change the summary file path
 - Change the eff. mass file path
 - Recompile `AsimovQSubNO` and `AsimovQSubIO`

To change to a new range of files to write to:
 - Change in the generate_.py scripts in `qsub/` the range to a new range
 - Change in the submit_.py scripts in `qsub/` the range to a new range

To change from a normal run to a cross-check run:
 - In generate_.py scripts in `qsub/` add "_cc" to the jobname that is used for the output `.sh` file.
 - In the generate_.py scripts in `qsub/` add "/cross_check/" to the command path.
 - In the submit_.py scripts in `qsub/` add "_cc_" to the qsub output files
 - In the submit_.py scripts in `qsub/` add "_cc_" to the jobname of the `.sh` file that is submitted.
