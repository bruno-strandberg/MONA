This folder contains the ipython/jupyter notebooks used to create some of the plots.
I prefer to commit python scripts, however in this instance this is an experiment on
how well I can use and maintain these notebooks in the context of a physics analysis. 
The past has showed this to be quite the challenge.

To run these notebooks, run the ROOT macros first that generate the output that is 
needed as input for these notebooks. These can be found in the 
`$NMHDIR/macros/asimov_fits/cross_check_macros/` directory.
At the time being the two plots `PercentageMC` and `RandomQ` depend on respectively 
`AsimovFit*_RandomQ.C` macros and the `AsimovFitNO_PercentageOfMC.C` macro.
The former can be run locally, the latter has to be run on the grid to gather enough
statistics. See the ``$NMHDIR/macros/asimov_fits/qsub` directory for these scripts.
