Log-likelihood scanner
======================

This application can be used to scan the likelihood with respect to a specific variable while keeping other parameters fixed. The output plots serve as general guidance to the sensitivity of the experiment to the specific parameter.

The application uses 3 PID regions (i.e. a track, shower and middle channel are fitted simultaneously). It specifies binning settings and muon and noise cuts that should work in a wide variety of cases. This application and the settings do not aim to configure the best possible selection, the application is set up to get a general sense of the sensitivity to a certain parameter.
