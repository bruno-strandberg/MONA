Log-likelihood scanner
======================

This application can be used to scan the likelihood with respect to a specific variable while keeping other parameters fixed or free. The output plots serve as general guidance to the sensitivity of the experiment to the specific parameter.

By default, The application uses 3 PID regions (i.e. a track, shower and middle channel are fitted simultaneously). It specifies binning settings and default muon and noise cuts that should work in a wide variety of cases. This application and the settings do not aim to configure the best possible selection, the application is set up to get a general sense of the sensitivity to a certain parameter.

The user interface allows a flexibility in setting PID regions and noise and muon cuts, but requires some concentration on part of the user.
